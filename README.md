# Customer Demand Forecasting

## Problem Statement
Accurate demand forecasting is critical for inventory planning and supply chain efficiency.
This project focuses on forecasting customer demand using historical sales data across
multiple product categories.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical sales transactions with time-based attributes such as
order date, product category, and quantity sold.

## Approach
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand seasonality and trends
- Engineered time-based features including lag variables and rolling statistics
- Built and compared regression and time-series models
- Evaluated models using standard error metrics

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering on temporal variables
3. Model training and comparison
4. Interpretation of seasonal patterns and demand drivers

## Results
The analysis identified strong seasonal trends and demand patterns across product
categories. Model comparison helped select a stable forecasting approach suitable
for planning use cases.

## Notes
This project focuses on analytical modeling and evaluation rather than production
deployment.
